# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Monika Marek**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**FunNum** is an android app that **displays the facts about numbers fetched from Numbers API. There are two options: numbers pulled randomly, or a user can switch to user mode and enter their own value.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: âœ¨ðŸ¤¯ðŸ’¥

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **userNumber**
- [x] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Toggle Switch so that the user can decide themself whether they want a random number fact or they want to specify the number!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **Numbers API**.
